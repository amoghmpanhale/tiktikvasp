This project is designed to be a custom version of tiktok for a study being ran at the University of Alberta. I do not claim any credit for the design and layout as that is referenced from Tiktok. Furthermore, some of the icons are derived from the icon pack linked below. The AI coding tool "Claude" was also used in places for debugging and refactoring in order to ensure the code is optimized and well documented.
